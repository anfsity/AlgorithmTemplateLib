# Algorithm Template Library (atl)

This is a toy project for me, mainly used to familiarize with modern CMake and CI/CD process.

But it also serves as a modern algorithm template library, designed to be both fast and readable.

## Features 

- **Modern C++**: Utilizes C++20 feature s for cleaner, more expressive, and efficient code.
- **CMake Integration**: Provides a modern CMake interface for seamless integration into other projects.

## Notes

 - 0-Based Indexing API: All data structure you use should be 0-based, and my library will automatically process those whose 1-based structure is more conventional into 1-based data structure. Such as FenwickTree.

 - C++20 Compiler: This project requires a compiler that supports C++20. Recent version of Clang (recommend) or GCC will work.
